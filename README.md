# Tower Of Babel
### Proposal:
We will be creating a story based horror game called, The Tower of Babel. The game places you in control of a father trying to find his lost son, who has been kidnapped and possessed by demons. You must decipher the demons language, and learn more about it to advance through the game, find your son, and lift the curse that was placed on him.
	This game will be played in first/third person perspective, as you will be playing in control of the father. We plan to use unity to make this game. We expect to run into some difficulty with getting unique models, and the level design. As a solution we will try to make them ourselves using Blender, or possible even buying them. But we want to make them ourselves.
